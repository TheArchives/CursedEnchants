CursedEnchants
==============

This is a Spigot (not Bukkit) plugin that attempts to make the Minecraft
enchantments system more interesting and less OP. It adds "negative enchantments",
or curses, that may be applied randomly when someone goes to enchant their gear.

This plugin is in the early stages, so not much information is available yet. If you
want to suggest a curse, please feel free to comment on the relevant ticket.
